## Objective:
The objective of this assignment was to analyze and visualize citi-bike data from the month of August in New York City.  We used Tableau to create all of the visualizations and stories.

## Results:
From the citi-bike data we created 5 visualizations.  Each visual was unique and captured a different characteristic about the citi-bike ridership trends. Of the 5 visuals, we selected 3 for our [story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.szymkowiak/viz/BikeSharingChallenge_16333180002630/Citi-Bike?publish=ye).  The first visual of the story demonstrates the number of bikes checked out at various hours of the day.  We can see that the early morning is the most popular time for bike checkouts.  

The second visual we selected was the breakdown of genders checking out bikes.  From this visual we can see that men check out more bikes than both women and unknown genders.  Perhaps with some different advertising, we could increase the ridership of females and unknown gender.

The third visual is a heatmap that compares the different genders and the different types of user (customer and subscriber). The heatmap shows us that subscribers make up the bulk of the rides in NYC.  These three visuals help to demonstrate that male subscribers make up the majority of citi-bike ridership.

## Summary:
From the story we can conclude that subscribers that identify as male make up the majority of riders for citi-bikes.  This gives us a great target population to use in other areas we want to bring bikes to.  One additional visual that might help us would be to analyze the relationship between weather and ridership.  Another visual would be to analyze the trends of ridership throughout the year rather than just the month of August.

All of the visuals can be viewed under this [profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.szymkowiak).
